    "## Creating a TNC (Termina Node Controller, e.g., modem) class\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture we chose for this lab is to create a class that implements the functions of the modem, while keeping joint state variables such that it would be possible to process buffers in real-time while maintaining continuity and integrity of the processing as if we are processing a large buffer. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We created the infrastructure for you, implemented in the `TNCaprs` class. \n",
    "It implelents an overlapp and save approach. The constructor for the class takes in the sampling frequency: `fs` the size of pyAudio buffer: `Abuffer` and the number of audio buffers to collect before processing:`Nchunks`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `processBuffer(self, buff_in)`\n",
    "The method `processBuffer(buff_in)` takes buffers in to be processed, collects them into a large buffer made of `Nchunks`. Once the large buffer has been collected, the method calls the demodulation method to create an NRZI, it calls the PLL to find the sampling timings, it samples the NRZI and converts it to NRZ bits. Finally it calls the function that looks for packets in the bitstream. \n",
    "The method implements an overlapp and save approach. So, it calls the demodulation function with a buffer that is overlaping and expects a smaller buffer, that contains only valid linear convolution samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### `demod(self, buff)` -- same as `nc_afsk1200Demod`\n",
    "Because there are 3 filters one after the other in the demodulator, each one of length N, the method `processBuffer(buff_in)` sends to `demod` a buffer sized `Nchunks*Abuffer + 3*(N-1)` and expects `Nchunks*Abuffer` samples in return. If you have different size filters, you need to modify `processBuffer(buff_in)` to account for that. The filters for `demod` are generated in the `__init__` function of the `TNCaprs` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ` PLL(self, NRZa)`\n",
    "This is the same PLL implementation as before. The only different is that the PLL counter: `pll`, its previous value: `ppll`, the stepsize: `dpll` and the agressivness or scaling factor `apll` are all class variables. This way, when the PLL finishes processing a buffer, the valuse are saved and used in the beginning of the next buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `findPackets(self,bits)`\n",
    "This function is the same as before. The only differences are that the variables, `state`, `pktcounter`, and `packet` are class variable and their value is kept from one call to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference is that we also added another variable: `bitpointer`. As you recall, the function looks for flags in the bitstream up to 7 bits before the end of the buffer. `bitpointer` is needed for the case where a flag is detected at the end of the buffer and extend to these 7 bits. That means that when we process the next buffer, we need to start after those bits, and `bitpointer` points to the bit we need to start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `modulate(self, bits)` -- same as `afsk1200`\n",
    "Function takes bits and afsk 1200 modulates them. The sampling rate is initialized in  `TNCaprs.__init__`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `modulatPacket(self, callsign, digi, dest, info, preflags=80, postflags=80 )`\n",
    "        \n",
    "Given callsign, digipath, dest, info, number of pre-flags and post-flags the function contructs an appropriate aprs packet, then converts them to NRZI and calls `modulate` to afsk 1200 modulate the packet. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task: \n",
    "* Convers your functions `nc_afsk1200Demod` and  `afsk1200` to `TNCaprs.demod` and `TNCaprs.modulate`. Make it into class form in which class vriables are in the form of `self.variable` which are initialized in `TNCaprs.__init__`. \n",
